# Pandas Analysis Report

For this project, I analyzed a small dataset containing elite competitive swimmers, their countries, the events they competed in, their recorded race times (converted into total seconds), and the date of each performance. The dataset was created specifically for this assignment and represents world-class swimmers across several strokes and distances. After loading the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, I validated the structure of the dataset by printing the first five rows, viewing column information with `info()`, and reviewing descriptive statistics using `describe()`. I then demonstrated indexing and selection techniques by accessing rows through both label-based (`loc`) and position-based (`iloc`) indexing, slicing multiple rows, selecting individual columns, and retrieving a single cell.

To show filtering with Boolean expressions, I created one filter using a single comparison operator to select swimmers with times under 52 seconds, and a second filter combining two conditions using the `&` operator to select swimmers from the United States who competed in Freestyle events. I also added a new column to the DataFrame and demonstrated how to remove a column using `.drop()`. Finally, I performed a groupby operation that grouped swimmers by country and calculated the average race time for each group, illustrating a basic split-apply-combine workflow.

From this analysis, I observed meaningful differences in performance across countries, as well as variation between race distances and event types. The dataset is small and does not include many entries for each category, which limits deeper statistical analysis, but it is clean and consistent enough to clearly demonstrate all required pandas operations. No missing values were present, though the original time formats needed standardization to ensure accurate comparisons. Overall, the dataset functioned well for practicing and applying the data manipulation techniques covered in Class.
